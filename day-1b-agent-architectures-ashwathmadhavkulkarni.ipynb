Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n\n**For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

The output of one agent automatically becomes the input for the next, creating a predictable and reliable workflow.\n\n**Use Sequential when:** Order matters, you need a linear pipeline, or each step builds on the previous one.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [sequential agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Blog Post Creation Pipeline**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"User Input: Blog about AI\"] -- > B[\"Outline Agent\"]\n    B -- >|blog_outline| C[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    C -- >|blog_draft| D[\"Editor Agent\"]\n    D -- >|final_blog| E[\"Output\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffcccc\n    style C fill:#ccffcc\n    style D fill:#ccccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/sequential-agent.png\" alt=\"Sequential Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1 Example: Blog Post Creation with Sequential Agents\n\nLet's build a system with three specialized agents:\n\n1. **Outline Agent** - Creates a blog outline for a given topic\n2. **Writer Agent** - Writes a blog post\n3. **Editor Agent** - Edits a blog post draft for clarity and structure","metadata":{"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Outline Agent: Creates the initial blog post outline.\noutline_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"OutlineAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Create a blog outline for the given topic with:\n    1.

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T08:15:57.362801Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T08:15:57.363099Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T08:15:57.368695Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T08:15:57.363079Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T08:15:57.367915Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

It was a quiet night, the sea a hushed murmur below. Then, a flicker. Not the steady pulse of his lamp, but something softer, emanating from his worn sea chest. He’d forgotten to close it properly. Inside, nestled amongst faded charts and barnacle-encrusted tools, lay a vellum scroll. It pulsed with an ethereal, sapphire glow. As he unrolled it, intricate lines shimmered into view, forming not earthly coastlines, but swirling constellations and impossible seas. A single, pulsing point marked a location far beyond any known horizon. Elias, a man of routine and salt spray, felt a thrill, a dangerous curiosity, ignite within him. The map was a secret, a promise, and it beckoned him towards the unknown.\nCriticAgent > The story is intriguing, but the pacing feels a bit rushed in the discovery of the map, and Elias's character could be more deeply explored to make his reaction to the map more impactful.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Expand the initial setting and Elias's routine:** Before introducing the map, spend a little more time establishing Elias's solitude and the monotony of his life. This will make the sudden appearance of the map more startling and his internal shift more significant. Perhaps show him performing a mundane task or reflecting on his isolation to heighten the contrast.\n\n2.  **Build suspense around the chest and the map's discovery:** Instead of Elias simply forgetting to close the chest, perhaps there's a slight anomaly that draws his attention to it. A strange sound, an unusual draft, or even a faint luminescence *before* he opens it could create more mystery and anticipation. Detail his initial hesitation or confusion upon seeing the glow.\n\n3.  **Develop Elias's internal reaction more explicitly:** While you mention a \"thrill\" and \"dangerous curiosity,\" delve a little deeper into *why* this map captivates him. Is he bored with his life? Does he have a longing for adventure he's suppressed? Showing a brief internal monologue or a physical reaction (e.g., a racing heart, a trembling hand) could make his decision to pursue the map more compelling.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the familiar arc of the Fresnel lens, its rhythmic sweep a hypnotic lullaby against the vast, indifferent ocean. For twenty years, this isolated rock had been his world, the rhythmic pulse of the lighthouse his only constant companion. Tonight, the sea below was a hushed murmur, the silence broken only by the lonely cry of a distant gull. Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the immensity of his solitude. He ran a calloused thumb over a speck of salt on the polished brass, a small act of defiance against the encroaching monotony. His life was a predictable cycle of light, fog, and the endless horizon, a life he’d chosen, yet one that often left a hollow ache in his chest. He often wondered if there was more beyond the endless blue, a silent question that echoed the vastness surrounding him.\n\nA sudden, almost imperceptible draft snaked through the lantern room, ruffling the edge of a faded nautical chart tacked to the wall. Elias frowned. The sea chest, a sturdy oak behemoth filled with the detritus of his solitary existence—faded charts, tarnished tools, a chipped mug—was usually sealed tight. But tonight, he distinctly remembered securing its heavy lid. Yet, as his gaze drifted towards it, he saw it: a faint, sapphire luminescence seeping from beneath the warped wood. It wasn’t the steady, reliable beam of his lamp, but something softer, otherworldly. A prickle of unease, then a surge of something akin to wonder, crawled up his spine. His heart gave an uncharacteristic lurch. Hesitantly, he approached the chest, his boots echoing in the sudden quiet. He knelt, his fingers brushing against the cool, damp wood, and with a creak of aged hinges, lifted the lid.\n\nThe glow intensified, spilling from the chest like trapped moonlight. Nestled amongst the mundane clutter lay a vellum scroll, emanating the soft, sapphire light. Elias, a man whose life was governed by the precise and the practical, stared, mesmerized. His hands, usually steady as the lighthouse tower itself, trembled as he reached for it. He unrolled the scroll with a reverence he hadn’t felt since his first day on the rock. Intricate lines shimmered into view, twisting and turning not to form earthly coastlines, but to depict swirling constellations and seas that defied any known cartography. It was a map of the impossible, a celestial chart of waters that never were. And there, at its heart, a single, pulsing point of light marked a location that lay impossibly far beyond any horizon he had ever known. A forgotten yearning, buried deep beneath years of routine and resignation, flared within him. This wasn't just a map; it was a whisper of a life unlived, a siren call to adventure that Elias, the stoic keeper of the light, could no longer ignore. The loneliness that had once been a comfort now felt like a cage, and the glowing map was the key.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
